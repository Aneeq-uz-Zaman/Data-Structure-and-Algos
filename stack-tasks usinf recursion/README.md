# Stack and Recursion Solutions

This folder contains recursive C++ solutions for a set of stack and string problems (Q1–Q14) implemented in `solutions.cpp`.

Build (Windows, cmd.exe):

Use a C++ compiler such as g++ (MinGW) or MSVC (cl).

Example with g++ (MinGW):

g++ -std=c++17 -O2 "solutions.cpp" -o "solutions.exe"

Run:

solutions.exe

Notes:
- All implementations use recursion rather than explicit stack data structures where possible.
- Q13: "Stack Folding Problem" - this README cannot perform web searches. Look up "stack folding problem" or "folding a stack" online; common topics include folding algorithms, fold operations on lists, and problems on stack reordering.
- If you want additional tests or to split functions into headers/source files, I can refactor.
